## What is it

It's a little Node / Express app that gathers (and then polls) data from the GOV.UK performance platform.

### Getting started

Make sure you have [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and NPM installed.<br>
Run ``` npm install ``` to get the packages you need.<br>
Once that's done, ``` grunt ``` will get you running on ``` localhost:3000 ``` with sass watching.

### The offline version

```grunt offline``` will package up the app in a single html file. It will use _yesterday's_ realtime data.

### Hard-coded data

Items to check and update, because they are currently hard coded in ``` /public/index.html ```.<br>
To do: make these dynamic.
